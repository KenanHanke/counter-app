# Counter App

A simple web app made for those of us who have to count neurons (or anything else) and
want to do so ergonomically. It's hosted at
[kenanhanke.github.io/counter-app](https://kenanhanke.github.io/counter-app/), can
be opened & used while offline (thanks to service workers), and has a fully persistent state.

The app was built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/).
The following commands are relevant for development:

- `npm start` to start the development server
- `npm run build` to build the app for production
- `npm run deploy` to deploy the app to GitHub Pages
